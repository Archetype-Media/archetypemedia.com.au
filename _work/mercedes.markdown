To celebrate the launch of Mercedes-Benz GLA 180 Activity Edition, Archetype Media collaborated with Ta-ku to create a series of short films. The result was two short films, one titled ‘Lost Without You’ that explored love and loss, blurring the lines between past and present, dream and reality. The other a behind the scenes look into a day in the life of the serial creative and entrepreneur.
